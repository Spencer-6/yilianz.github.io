<ul>
    <li><b><b> USCA Code of Conduct.</b> </b>Students will conduct
themselves in class in accordance with the standards noted in the USCA
Student Handbook. From the USCA Student Handbook: <i>It is the
instructor's right to remove from the classroom any student who
disrupts or disturbs the proceeding of the class. If the student who
has been ejected causes similar disturbances in subsequent meetings of
the class, he/she may be denied admittance to the class for the
remainder of the semester and assigned a grade of F. </i></li>
  <li><b><b> Attendance Policy:</b></b> Class attendance is required.
It
is
highly recommended that you do not miss any class. More than
4 unexcused absences may result in a grade of F for the course. Excused
absences will be granted for documented incapacitating illness,
official representation of the University, death of a close relative,
religious holidays, jury duty, or subpoena to appear in court. Arriving
late or leaving early will count as 1/2 absence.<b> </b></li>
  <li><b> Special Circumstance: </b> If you have a physical,
psychological, and/or learning disability that might affect your
performance in this class, please contact the Office of Disability
Services, B &amp; E 134, (803) 643-6816, as soon as possible. The
Office of Disability Services will determine appropriate accommodations
based on documentation. </li>
  <li><b> Academic Integrity:</b> Please read and review the
Academic Code of Conduct relating to Academic Integrity located in USC
Aiken Student Handbook, 2015-2016, (<a
 href="http://web.usca.edu/student-life-and-services/student-handbook/disciplinary-procedures-for-violations-of-academic-integrity.dot">http://web.usca.edu/student-life-and-services/student-handbook/disciplinary-procedures-for-violations-of-academic-integrity.dot</a>).
If you are found to be
in violation of academic integrity, a grade of F(0) may be given for
the work. Additionally, a grade of F may be assigned for the course
and/or further sanctions may be pursued. <br>
  </li>
  <li><b> CELL PHONES/PAGERS:</b> As a courtesy to the class, cell
phones and pagers should be placed in such a mode that they will not
disturb the class. </li></ul>
